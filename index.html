      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p> I am from Chandler, Arizona. I love the sun and the outdoors. On the weekends in the summer you can find me chilling by the pool. I love love sports. Especially football. In the fall if there is a football game on you know I will be watching. Especailly if BYU or the AZ cardinals are playing. When I am not watching sports or spending time outdoors you can find me playing one of my four guitars. </p>
